== Description ==

= Introduction =

Easily create and manage PayPal Standard payment buttons within WordPress, and place them on Pages / Posts using shortcodes.

 * Buy Now Button
 * Donation Button
 * Subscription Button
 * Shopping Cart Button / View Cart Button
 * Shortcodes for easy placement of buttons on Pages / Posts

= Security =

The primary objective of this plugin is to provide a way to use PayPal Standard buttons in a secure way.

Other similar PayPal button plugins will allow you to create a button and display on a page, however, these buttons are not protected in any way.  This allows potential fraudsters to obtain the HTML code that makes up the PayPal button, change the values (ie. item price, shipping amount, etc.) and then submit a payment using those bogus values.

PayPal WP Button Manager is a more advanced solution which utilizes the [PayPal Button Manager API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/button-manager/integration-guide/NVP/ButtonMgrOverview/) to generate buttons as opposed to basic HTML, which gives you the option to create PayPal Hosted buttons.  These buttons and all of their details are saved in your PayPal account which keeps them safe from prying eyes.  The only thing one could see when viewing the HTML for a PayPal Hosted button is the button ID, and this is worthless to a potential fraudster.

= User Friendly Interface =

We have essentially replicated the PayPal Button Manager experience you see in your PayPal account, however, we have tightly integrated it into the WordPress admin panel.  This allows you to create and your PayPal buttons without ever leaving your site.

= Create Buttons for Multiple PayPal Accounts =

Within the plugin you may create one or more companies (PayPal accounts).  When creating a new button, the first step is to choose which company / account you will be creating the button for.  This provides the ability to create and manage buttons for any number of PayPal accounts within a single installation.

= Options for Button Usage =

After creating your PayPal button you will have multiple options for how to place it in various pages, posts, emails, etc.

First, the Visual Editor in WordPress provides a Shortcodes menu with all of the buttons you have created available for point and click placement.  The actual shortcode values themselves are made available as well so you can simply type them out or copy/paste if you prefer.

You will also have access to the entire HTML snippet that is returned by the PayPal Button Manager API as well as a basic URL link that could be used in emails, social network posts, graphical links, etc.

With numerous options for placement of buttons, you will not have any problems using them wherever you would like.

= Localization =

The PayPal Express Checkout buttons and checkout pages will translate based off your WordPress language setting by default.  The rest of the plugin was also developed with localization in mind and is ready for translation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin more secure than others? =

* PayPal WP Button Manager utilizes the PayPal Button Manager API which provides tighter integration with PayPal's system and allows you to create PayPal hosted payment buttons.  These buttons remove all of the detail about the payment from the HTML viewable through view-source in a web browser, so they will not be able to hack the code and submit payments with bogus values.

= How do I create sandbox accounts for testing? =

* Login at http://developer.paypal.com.
* Click the Applications tab in the top menu.
* Click Sandbox Accounts in the left sidebar menu.
* Click the Create Account button to create a new sandbox account.
* TIP: Create at least one "seller" account and one "buyer" account if you want to fully test a button through the entire checkout experience.

= Where do I get my API credentials? =

* Live credentials can be obtained by signing in to your live PayPal account here:  https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_get-api-signature&generic-flow=true
* Sandbox credentials can be obtained by viewing the sandbox account profile within your PayPal developer account, or by signing in with a sandbox account here:  https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_get-api-signature&generic-flow=true
